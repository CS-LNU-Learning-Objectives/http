# HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
This text is about HTTP, the protocol that all web applications use and all web developers should know about. HTTP is the protocol that clients and servers is using to understand the requests and responses. HTTP is a protocol, a set of rules, that is using the underlying Internet protocols. HTTP/www is a application running on the internet, just as e-mails (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) or file transfers applications (FTP).

In the underlaying layers of the Internet model we find protocols like IP (Internet protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System). Through IP servers and clients can find and address each other. Through TCP they can connect and uphold a connection to each other. Through the DNS we can map domain names like www.lnu.se to ip-numbers as 194.47.110.233.

All this protocols är working together in different layers with HTTP on top to make HTTP requests and responses. Below is a image of the so called TCP/IP-modell that illustrates this.

### History
When Sir Tim Bernes-Lee created the application www, today known as "The web" http was one of the three pillars along with HTML end URL. The specification has been developed through the years but the latest specification HTTP 1.1 was presented in 1999 and is the specification we still use today. Think about it and think how the web applications looked back then and what how they look today. As we will see the old specifications have their problem in the demanding world of modern web development and a new specification is on its way (and in some sense already implemented.)

#### HTTP 0.9
This is a old version that is not in the use these days. It only support GET request, meaning you only could GET web pages don´t POST data from example a HTML form.

#### HTTP 1.0

#### HTTP 1.1

### HTTP Headers

### HTTP Status Codes
